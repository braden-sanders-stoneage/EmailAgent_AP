# Invoice Import Feature - Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed Implementation

All components of the invoice import feature have been successfully implemented. Here's what was built:

---

## 1. Backend Modules

### `core/utils/vendor_finder.py`
**Purpose:** Fuzzy matching of vendor names against Epicor vendor database

**Functions:**
- `get_all_vendors(company='SAINC')` - Queries Epicor for all vendors
- `fuzzy_match_vendor(extracted_name, vendor_list)` - Returns top 5 vendor matches with confidence scores
- `match_vendor_from_invoice(extracted_name, company='SAINC')` - Main entry point combining both operations

**Key Features:**
- Uses fuzzywuzzy library for string matching
- Returns top 5 matches sorted by confidence
- Extensive debug prints for tuning
- Multiple matching algorithms (ratio, partial_ratio, token_sort_ratio)

---

### `core/ai/invoice_extractor.py`
**Purpose:** AI-powered extraction of invoice data from emails and PDFs

**Data Model:**
```python
InvoiceData:
  - vendor_name (with confidence score)
  - invoice_number (with confidence score)
  - invoice_date (with confidence score)
  - invoice_total (with confidence score)
  - line_items: List[
      - line_description
      - quantity
      - unit_price
      - line_total (optional)
      - confidence
    ]
  - extraction_notes
```

**Key Features:**
- Uses OpenAI GPT-5 with structured outputs
- Analyzes email body + PDF attachments
- Provides confidence scores (0-100) for each field
- Handles variable line item formats
- Medium reasoning effort for better accuracy

---

### `core/integrations/epicor/invoice_creator.py`
**Purpose:** Creates draft invoices in Epicor ERP via API

**Functions:**
- `create_ap_invoice_group(company)` - Creates invoice group
- `create_ap_invoice_header(...)` - Creates invoice header with vendor, date, total
- `create_ap_invoice_lines(...)` - Creates line items with qty, price, description
- `create_invoice_in_epicor(invoice_data)` - Main orchestration function

**Workflow:**
1. Lookup vendor_num and terms_code from vendor_id
2. Generate unique invoice group ID
3. Create invoice header
4. Create invoice lines
5. Return success + Epicor deep link URL

**Key Features:**
- Simplified from original workflow script (no GL codes, no misc charges)
- Stores actual quantity and unit price (not 1/-1)
- Handles line_total if provided, otherwise calculates it
- Duplicate detection and graceful error handling
- Comprehensive debug output

---

### `core/integrations/epicor/client.py` (Updated)
**Added:**
- `generate_group_name()` - Creates unique invoice group IDs with timestamp + UUID

---

### `core/utils/email_processor.py` (Updated)
**Changes:**
- Now checks if email is categorized as `new_invoice`
- Automatically extracts invoice data using AI
- Matches vendor using fuzzy matching
- Includes extracted invoice data + vendor matches in JSON cache
- All happens automatically in background when email arrives

---

### `app.py` (Updated)
**Added Route:**
```python
POST /api/invoice/import
```

**Accepts:**
- vendor_id
- invoice_num
- invoice_date
- invoice_total
- line_items (array)

**Returns:**
- success (boolean)
- epicor_url (deep link to invoice)
- error message (if failed)

**Validation:**
- Checks for required fields
- Validates data before calling Epicor

---

## 2. Frontend Components

### `static/css/taskpane.css` (Updated)
**Added Styles:**
- Invoice data section with header fields
- Vendor dropdown with confidence indicators
- Line items toggle button and table
- Editable table inputs
- Import button styling
- Success modal
- Confidence indicator colors (green/yellow/red)

---

### `templates/taskpane.html` (Updated)
**Added Section:**
```html
<div id="invoiceDataSection">
  - Vendor dropdown (top 5 matches)
  - Invoice number field
  - Invoice date field
  - Invoice total field
  - Line items toggle button
  - Editable line items table
  - Import to Epicor button
</div>
```

**Display Logic:**
- Only shows if category is `new_invoice`
- Only shows if invoice data was extracted
- Only shows if invoice NOT already found in Epicor

---

### `static/js/taskpane.js` (Updated)
**Added Functions:**
- `displayInvoiceData(invoiceData)` - Populates form fields with extracted data
- `renderConfidenceIndicator(score)` - Shows green/yellow/red icon based on score
- `toggleLineItems()` - Expands/collapses line items table
- `collectInvoiceData()` - Gathers all form data including edits
- `importToEpicor()` - POSTs to API, handles success/error
- `showSuccessModal(epicorUrl)` - Shows success message with "Open in Epicor" button

**UI Behavior:**
- Vendor dropdown shows top 5 matches with confidence %
- All fields are editable before import
- Line items displayed in expandable table
- Confidence indicators next to each field
- Loading state on import button
- Success modal with deep link to Epicor

---

### `outlook-addin/manifest.xml` (Updated)
**Changed:**
- Added `<RequestedWidth>700</RequestedWidth>` to make add-in wider

---

## 3. Dependencies

### `requirements.txt` (Updated)
**Added:**
- `fuzzywuzzy` - Fuzzy string matching for vendor lookup
- `python-Levenshtein` - Speeds up fuzzywuzzy calculations

---

## 4. Field Mappings

### AI Extraction ‚Üí Epicor Fields

**Header:**
- `vendor_name` ‚Üí Fuzzy matched to get `vendor_id` and `vendor_num`
- `invoice_number` ‚Üí `APInvHed.InvoiceNum`
- `invoice_date` ‚Üí `APInvHed.InvoiceDate` (converted to YYYY-MM-DD)
- `invoice_total` ‚Üí `APInvHed.ScrDocInvoiceVendorAmt`
- (hardcoded) ‚Üí `APInvHed.Description` = "This invoice was generated automatically by a brilliant AI assistant."

**Line Items:**
- `line_description` ‚Üí `APInvDtl.Description`
- `quantity` ‚Üí `APInvDtl.ScrVendorQty` (actual quantity)
- `unit_price` ‚Üí `APInvDtl.DocUnitCost` (actual unit price)
- `line_total` ‚Üí `APInvDtl.ScrDocExtCost` (or calculated if not provided)

**Derived Fields:**
- `vendor_num` ‚Üí Looked up via `get_vendor_data(vendor_id)`
- `terms_code` ‚Üí Looked up via `get_vendor_data(vendor_id)`
- `group_id` ‚Üí Auto-generated via `generate_group_name()`
- `company` ‚Üí Hardcoded as 'SAINC'

## 8. Known Limitations

1. **Vendor Matching:**
   - Relies on fuzzy matching - may need manual selection for ambiguous names
   - New vendors not in Epicor require manual creation first

2. **Invoice Extraction:**
   - AI accuracy varies by invoice format
   - Some invoices may have low confidence scores requiring manual review
   - Line items with complex structures may need manual editing

3. **No GL Code Assignment:**
   - Current implementation doesn't assign GL codes to line items
   - Ashley will need to assign GL codes in Epicor after import

4. **No PO Matching:**
   - Doesn't automatically match invoices to purchase orders
   - Future enhancement opportunity

5. **Single Company:**
   - Hardcoded to 'SAINC' company
   - Would need enhancement for multi-company support

---

## 9. Success Criteria

‚úÖ **Invoice data extracted automatically from emails**
‚úÖ **Top 5 vendor matches provided with confidence scores**
‚úÖ **All fields editable in UI before import**

---

## 10. Future Enhancements

1. **Auto-GL Code Assignment** - Use AI to suggest GL codes based on line descriptions
2. **PO Matching** - Automatically match invoices to open POs
3. **Duplicate Detection** - Warn if similar invoice already exists
